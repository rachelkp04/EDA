# EDA

<h4>What is EDA?</h4>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data-driven project. It involves analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. EDA helps uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions, providing valuable insights that guide further analysis or model-building. By visualizing relationships and distributions within the data, EDA allows you to make informed decisions and better understand the underlying structure of the dataset. It's an essential process for gaining insights before diving into complex modeling techniques.
